It consists of a very simple web page created with **HTML5 and CSS3** for learning purposes.

- __Footer__
    - The footer is featured underneath the whole website and contains an unordered inline list, with four social media icons (Instagram, Twitter and TikTok), which were linked with my personal social media pages. 
    -  The same color of the header was used here in order to order the website in its colors.
    - The social media icons were taken from Font Awesome icons and style with CSS. They are central positioned to offer to keep offering to the visitors a clear impression of the website.

## Tests

### Browser testing

- The browsers I have used to test the page were Chrome, Brave and Microsoft Edge. The same functioning could be seen.
- The tests were done using Windows 10 and Windows 11 Pro and Android 14 device (Google Pixel 6).

### Responsiveness

- I have tested that this page works on different screen sizes from Samsung Galaxy S8+ (360px wide) and large screens like 4k.
- The Chrome developer tool have been used to check the responsiveness of the website. 

### Validator Testing 

For Markup Validator I have used the W3C Validator and for CSS, the W3C CSS Validator Services to validate all pages of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in there. At the Markup Validator I found some warnings about the missing JavaScript code. The CSS Validator presented no errors.

- W3C Markup Validator (HTML)

I have confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in Chrome developer tools.

### Further Testing
- Navigation links on header: all works correctly.
- External links to the four social media channels: works correctly.
- I have tested that name, email and message is required to submit the form in the contact section.
- I have tested that the email input field must contain @ symbol to submit the form in the contact section.
- I have tested that the form submit button word "Submit" changes the color of the text when hovering over.

### Solved bugs
- The Home page section was not configured properly. So I have changed the CSS with, and it ran properly. 
- When testing on Brave browser using the developer tools, I realized that the Social Media icons were located to the left side and not centralized. I fixed this bug decreasing the padding.
- The logo was not sticky inside the head. I changed the position to fixed.


## Deployment

  - Log in to GitHub > GitHub repository > first-portfolio-project.
